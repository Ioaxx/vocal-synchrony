Overview

The image presents a series of boxplots comparing vocal features between two emotional states—baseline (blue) and aroused (orange)—across seven couples. The features analyzed are Pitch, Loudness, Jitter, Shimmer, Speechrate, Timbre, Energy, and Alignment. Each subplot shows the distribution of a specific feature for each couple, with the data separated by state.
Feature-by-Feature Summary

Pitch

    The median pitch values tend to be lower in the aroused state compared to the baseline state for most couples.

    There is a wider spread and more outliers in the baseline state, suggesting greater variability.

Loudness

    Loudness is generally higher in the baseline state, with aroused states showing lower medians and a more compressed range.

    This pattern is consistent across all couples.

Jitter

    Jitter values are similar between states, with overlapping boxes and medians.

    No substantial difference is observed between baseline and aroused states.

Shimmer

    Shimmer distributions are also similar between states, with only slight variations in medians and ranges.

Speechrate

    Speechrate is nearly identical between baseline and aroused states, with very tight distributions and minimal difference in medians.

    One couple (couple 3) shows a slightly lower median in the aroused state.

Timbre

    Timbre values are slightly higher in the aroused state for most couples, with the aroused state showing a wider spread.

    The difference is subtle but consistent.

Energy

    Energy is noticeably higher in the baseline state, with aroused states showing lower medians and tighter distributions.

    There are more outliers in the baseline state.

Alignment

    Alignment shows similar distributions between states, with only minor differences in medians and ranges.

Key Patterns

    baseline state: Generally associated with higher pitch, loudness, and energy, and greater variability in these features.

    Aroused state: Tends to show lower pitch, loudness, and energy, with slightly higher timbre and more compressed distributions for most features.

    Minimal differences: Jitter, shimmer, speechrate, and alignment show little to no consistent difference between states.

Interpretation

These results suggest that emotional arousal is most strongly reflected in reductions of pitch, loudness, and energy, while other vocal features remain relatively stable across emotional states. Timbre may increase slightly with arousal, but the effect is less pronounced. The consistency of these patterns across couples indicates that these vocal markers could be robust indicators of emotional state in dyadic interactions.

Summary of Results

The image displays violin plots comparing the distributions of several vocal features between two emotional states—baseline (blue) and aroused (orange)—across seven couples. Each subplot represents a different vocal feature, and significant differences between states are indicated by p-values above each pairwise comparison.
Key Observations by Feature

Pitch

    For all couples, pitch is significantly higher in the baseline state than in the aroused state (all p < 0.01).

    The distribution is wider in the baseline state, indicating more variability.

Loudness

    Loudness is consistently higher in the baseline state across all couples, with significant differences (all p < 0.05).

    The aroused state shows a narrower and lower distribution.

Jitter

    Jitter is significantly higher in the aroused state for couple 1 (p = 0.012), but not for the other couples.

    For most couples, distributions overlap substantially.

Shimmer

    Shimmer is significantly higher in the aroused state for several couples (p-values range from 0.000 to 0.034).

    The aroused state shows a slight upward shift in shimmer across most couples.

Speechrate

    Speechrate is significantly higher in the baseline state for all couples (all p = 0.000).

    The difference is visually apparent, with the baseline state showing a higher and tighter distribution.

Timbre

    Timbre is significantly higher in the baseline state for all couples (all p < 0.05).

    The baseline state displays a broader and higher distribution.

Energy

    Energy is markedly higher in the baseline state for all couples (all p = 0.000).

    The aroused state has a compressed, lower distribution.

Alignment

    Alignment is significantly higher in the baseline state for all couples (all p < 0.05).

    The baseline state shows a higher median and wider spread.

Comparative Table
Feature	baseline vs. Aroused (General Trend)	Significant Difference (p-value)
Pitch	Higher in baseline	Yes (all couples, p < 0.01)
Loudness	Higher in baseline	Yes (all couples, p < 0.05)
Jitter	Slightly higher in aroused (some)	Yes (couple 1, p = 0.012)
Shimmer	Higher in aroused (some)	Yes (most couples, p < 0.05)
Speechrate	Higher in baseline	Yes (all couples, p = 0.000)
Timbre	Higher in baseline	Yes (all couples, p < 0.05)
Energy	Higher in baseline	Yes (all couples, p = 0.000)
Alignment	Higher in baseline	Yes (all couples, p < 0.05)
Interpretation

    baseline state: Consistently associated with higher pitch, loudness, speechrate, timbre, energy, and alignment.

    Aroused state: Shows increased shimmer and, for some, jitter, but generally lower values for most other features.

    Statistical significance: Most differences are statistically significant, as indicated by the p-values, especially for pitch, loudness, speechrate, timbre, energy, and alignment.

These results indicate that vocal features are robustly modulated by emotional state, with the baseline state generally showing higher and more variable vocal characteristics, while the aroused state is marked by lower, more compressed distributions and increases in shimmer and, occasionally, jitter
