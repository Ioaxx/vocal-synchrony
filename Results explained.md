Overview

The image presents a series of boxplots comparing vocal features between two emotional states—normal (blue) and aroused (orange)—across seven couples. The features analyzed are Pitch, Loudness, Jitter, Shimmer, Speechrate, Timbre, Energy, and Alignment. Each subplot shows the distribution of a specific feature for each couple, with the data separated by state.
Feature-by-Feature Summary

Pitch

    The median pitch values tend to be lower in the aroused state compared to the normal state for most couples.

    There is a wider spread and more outliers in the normal state, suggesting greater variability.

Loudness

    Loudness is generally higher in the normal state, with aroused states showing lower medians and a more compressed range.

    This pattern is consistent across all couples.

Jitter

    Jitter values are similar between states, with overlapping boxes and medians.

    No substantial difference is observed between normal and aroused states.

Shimmer

    Shimmer distributions are also similar between states, with only slight variations in medians and ranges.

Speechrate

    Speechrate is nearly identical between normal and aroused states, with very tight distributions and minimal difference in medians.

    One couple (couple 3) shows a slightly lower median in the aroused state.

Timbre

    Timbre values are slightly higher in the aroused state for most couples, with the aroused state showing a wider spread.

    The difference is subtle but consistent.

Energy

    Energy is noticeably higher in the normal state, with aroused states showing lower medians and tighter distributions.

    There are more outliers in the normal state.

Alignment

    Alignment shows similar distributions between states, with only minor differences in medians and ranges.

Key Patterns

    Normal state: Generally associated with higher pitch, loudness, and energy, and greater variability in these features.

    Aroused state: Tends to show lower pitch, loudness, and energy, with slightly higher timbre and more compressed distributions for most features.

    Minimal differences: Jitter, shimmer, speechrate, and alignment show little to no consistent difference between states.

Interpretation

These results suggest that emotional arousal is most strongly reflected in reductions of pitch, loudness, and energy, while other vocal features remain relatively stable across emotional states. Timbre may increase slightly with arousal, but the effect is less pronounced. The consistency of these patterns across couples indicates that these vocal markers could be robust indicators of emotional state in dyadic interactions.
